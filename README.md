# Blender-Cave-Generation
Cave Generation using metaballs in Blender. Originally created by sdfgeoff, Edited by Myself (Archie Jaskowicz).

## Installation
To install this plugin, download the python script and open blender. Then go to "Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install". Then navigate to the python script and click "install Add-on".

Once that's added, search for CaveGen in the search bar (located under "Install" at the top right of Preferences), make sure the "Community" box is on (shift-click it) and the enable "CaveGen" by clicking on the tick box.

## How to use

When opening the menu to add an object, go to "Mesh -> Cave Generation".

## Known Issues

- Lighting is, not only buggy, but placing too often. This can be slightly fixed by altering the light rate but it's still far too much.
- Location (and rotation?) doesn't update the cave when being edited from the dropdown menu on cave creation. Location and rotation can be altered from the properties or just with tools.

## Features I aim to implement.

- Better cave generation
